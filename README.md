# Deep learning for magnetic phase transition
This repository is build for discovering phase transition in various spin models with deep learning method. 
Including: 
1. PCA method for 2D Ising model (unsupervised learning method).
2. AutoEncoder neural network for 2D Iisng model (unsupervised deep learning method).
3. VAE neural network for 2D Ising model (unsupervised deep learning method).
4. Binary classification neural network for magnetic transition in 2D-Ising model (CNN method).
5. Binary classification neural network for Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in 2D-XY model (CNN method).
