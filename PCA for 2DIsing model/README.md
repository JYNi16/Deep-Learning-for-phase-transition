Discovering phase transition in 2DIsing model with unsupervised learning method 

Requirements: scikit-learn, numpy, numba and Python 

Quick start:

1. python MC_sample.py to generate the datasets, which includes two parts:
   (1). 20_L, 40_L and 80_L, in which "L" represent the size of 2D square Ising model;
   (2). For each part, we generate the datas in the range of temperature from 1 to 3.0, with each temperature containing 100 data points.

3. python sklearn_pca.py.
